(Platform repository, used for issues tracking, milestones publication etc.)

Dear merchants and developers, 

we are not using GitHub as our official Issue Tracker for everything related to Pencepay (the platform, libraries, shop plugins etc).

Please enter any issues you might find in Pencepay in the Issue Tracker, so that both we can see them clearly, and that you can get a transparent overview on how and when the issues are being fixed.

*Pencepay team*
